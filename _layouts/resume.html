Followed the software development and release management lifecycle processes to build and deploy components from and to Salesforce environments. Joining an organization with an existing and robust Salesforce instance and newly implemented CPQ application, I gained knowledge on the existing business functions and team coding standards through reading the existing code base. Collaborated with business engagement analysts and members from cross-functional teams to understand business needs and requirements. Designed technical solutions, documented technical designs, and built and/or enhanced components (apex classes, triggers, visualforce pages, javascript buttons, and process builders). Participated in coding peer reviews to ensure code readiness and functionality standards aligned with Salesforce and team defined principles. Learned NodeJS to help the senior developers implement a continuous integration process using Travis CI to automatically validate and deploy components between Salesforce Sandboxes and Production orgs from Github.</div>

Identified the technical needs based on existing processes and business requirements gathered during onsite interactions with stakeholders. During the design and build phase, worked closely with the project Technical Architect to identify third party applications and Salesforce Service Cloud features to automate and streamline processes onto the Salesforce platform. Working with the development team involved creating and assigning Jira tickets to developers based on user stories defined during the discovery phase, leading daily scrum calls and testing features built to validate functionality and identify defects/bugs. The project resulted in integrating 100+ employees of an EMEA call center onto Salesforce, which allowed them to perform call center tasks such as accept incoming calls, chats, emails and web2case, create cases to capture those interactions, and a workflow that captured the actions taken on a case from open to close. Extensive mapping and translation of the call center's legacy system data to the new Salesforce environment was completed to comply with audit policies and ensure employees could have access to a year's worth of case and contact data once the legacy system was deprecated.</div>

                                <i><strong>The Results:</strong></i> Moved from a non-dynamic and data table heavy design, to a low configuration approach that requires minimal code changes. A Salesforce Administrator would no longer be responsible for maintaining the data table of SKU nomenclatures and translations, instead that data would be captured on the CPQ Product and related objects level and an individual process would access this data and generate the translation.

                        </div>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="inner-row-left spacing">
                            <h3>Box</h3>

                                <i><strong>The What:</strong></i> Re-designed the CPQ Product SKU Translation process from data table driven to a dynamically generated approach. CPQ is a complex data structure and the data that was defined in the original design's data table was CPQ data, which resulted in an extra and redundant table to maintain. The re-design referenced the existing CPQ data and added new fields to capture the SKU nomenclature metadata and translations. Hence, low data structure changes were made since most of the data needed to generate the translations existed in the database. The challenge was getting the data for each nomenclature since CPQ has a hierarchial data structure, and most of the data lived at the lowest level of the tree.

                                <i><strong>The What:</strong></i> Designed the solution to display an external site on the Salesforce platform through implementing an iframe within a Visualforce Page. Worked with the external site's owner on the security changes required to render the site in Salesforce and bypass SSO and the mapping and translation of data. Built a Visualforce Page that utilized the JSForce API Library to query for object and mapping table data, performed mapping and translation of the external site's metadata to Salesforce data, and dynamically generated the url passed to the iframe.

                                <i><strong>The Results:</strong></i> Automated access of the asset database that lived on an external site to Sales users on the Salesforce platform, which rendered specific assets driven by Salesforce data.

                                <i><strong>The What:</strong></i> Led the configuration, design and implementation of a lightning component framework that triggered a one way SOAP integration from Salesforce to Workday. The lightning component was a built to facilitate a publicly accessible form for university students and employees to create a reimbursement, which would get captured in Workday. The SOAP integration utilized the Workday API to authenticate to a Workday user and post information captured on the form to Workday.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <i><strong>The Results:</strong></i> Integrated Salesforce and form data into Workday, which improved a manual process to an automatic workflow via an integration that triggered the reimbursement process in Workday and ensured that the reimbursement process was accessible by users with or without a login to the Salesforce instance.

                                <i><strong>The What:</strong></i> Developed a custom Visualforce page to automate the client's existing process of creating and editing Order Adjustments. The custom implementation allowed users to dynamically interact with the page, displayed computational data based on pre-defined formulas and the user's input, and ensured bulk friendliness.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <i><strong>The Results:</strong></i> Streamlined the client’s business process within Salesforce.com while expanding on the capabilities of the custom object's standard New and Edit buttons.

                                <i><strong>The What:</strong></i> Implemented a Salesforce Trigger for Lead Conversion, custom Trigger for the upsert of Opportunities based on clients requirements and developed a Jitterbit integration that called an existing Web Service to automate the integration of prospective and existing students from an external application into Salesforce Leads, Contacts, Accounts and Opportunities.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <i><strong>The Results:</strong></i> Redesigned and simplified the automation of student data from the client's external student database to Salesforce using the Jitterbit Web Service process and custom Apex Code that was triggered from the upsert of objects via the Jitterbit integration. The integration allowed the client to streamline their student lead conversion process for prospective students and a granular view of the amount of prospective students flowing into their system.

                                <i><strong>The What:</strong></i> Volunteered to lead planning for the BEN Black Future's Month Non-Profit Pop-up Happy Hour during Black History month. Planning involved reaching out to non-profits in the Bay Area that would be interested in showcasing their organization and providing educational information about Black Future's month to foster a community for BEN and Box employees to enjoy food and conversations with non-profit organizations in celebration of Black History month and to learn how to get involved with the non-profit organizations in attendance. Challenges experienced during the planning of the event was scouting and communicating with all non-profit organizations, finalizing catering, office space reservations, decorations, and the flow of the event, and getting volunteers the day of the event to help with office space setup. The event was a success and received great feedback from Box employees that attended, the five non-profit organizations that were invited and the BEN leadership team. I created a template for the event that detailed the budget and outlined the event purpose and agenda. This template received accolades as a useful outline for future events during the BEN offsite by BEN's former co-chair.

                                <i><strong>The What:</strong></i> Participated in an all-women 12 hour hackathon by the <strong>Girl Develop It Buffalo Chapter</strong> where my team designed and developed a website for a locally owned business to help improve their online presence.
                                <br/><br/>
                                <i><strong>The Results:</strong></i> The team developed a new WordPress site from scratch during the duration of 12 hours. The client wanted the ability to allow site visitors to subscribe to their existing subscription list, an e-commerce store, and a showcase of the charity work they've done via WordPress pages and posts. The team provided all the client's needs, as well as placed first in the entire hackathon.
